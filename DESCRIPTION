Description: Enhances R function execution by integrating AI-powered analysis 
    and insights. Captures function calls, arguments, and results, then uses 
    an AI assistant (via API integration) to analyze execution patterns, 
    detect potential issues, and provide optimization suggestions. Supports 
    saving analysis results in various formats (CSV, JSON, RDS, PNG, PDF, RData, etc.) and 
    includes tools for runtime code evaluation, help documentation access, 
    and detailed object inspection.
